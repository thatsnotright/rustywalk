# rustywalk
random walk in rust

learning rust by revisting my childhood learning c++ via "Simluations and Cellular Automata" by Scott Robert Ladd

I let the simluation go too long, and need a few tweaks for generating new cells, and I think there's an obvious bias by preferring the top left, top, top right cells for 'frozen' but it's a nifty image.
